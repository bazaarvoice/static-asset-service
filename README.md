# Static Asset Service

This repository supports a static asset service:

- [Assets](./assets/README.md): The assets that the service provides.
- [Generator](./generator/README.md): A tool for generating the compiled asset files, and deploying them to an s3 location.
- [Client-Side SDK](./sdk/README.md): A tool for client-side applications to use to request assets from the service.
